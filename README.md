# FretForge v1.6.0


- **Written drum dynamics:** Guitar Pro ghost and normal/heavy accent tags are preserved as Expert pad modifiers, independently of velocity inference. Written tags win over conflicting inferred velocity. Kick has no supported pad accent/ghost modifier. Lower difficulty reductions keep ordinary hits.
- **Extra media → Local stem separation:** select Song recording (or the active music video), choose **Install stem tools**, then **Separate song & assign stems**. Installation requires an existing Python 3.10/3.11; choose its executable or leave blank for `python` on PATH. Setup creates a private environment in your chosen folder and downloads pinned CPU Torch 2.5.1 / torchaudio 2.5.1 / Demucs 4.0.1; it does not modify system Python packages. Dependencies/model weights require internet and several GB of disk space. Subsequent separation runs locally using `htdemucs_6s`; audio is not uploaded. Progress and failures appear with a saved log. Vocal, Guitar, Bass and combined Drum outputs are assigned together after success; previous Rhythm/Keys/split drum selections are cleared because those sounds are covered by the new set. All originals remain intact.
- **Backing mix:** `other + piano` become the main backing audio; export uses that instead of duplicating the complete song alongside the four stems. Preview keeps the original audio/video recording. Generated stems/backing receive the shared padding/trimming; music video retains its linked offset. The generated set and Python location are saved with the project. If you change the source or individual assigned stems, clear the generated set before exporting. Clearing unassigns its files but leaves them on disk. Existing manually selected unrelated media is preserved.

Demucs's six-source guitar/piano model is experimental; review separation quality by ear. [Official Demucs documentation](https://github.com/facebookresearch/demucs#separating-tracks). Model inference and the dependency download are not included in the portable ZIP; use the in-app setup. The Windows app itself still runs without Python.

- **Sustains:** ordinary Guitar Pro quarter-note and shorter playback durations are no longer automatically treated as ringing notes. Longer notes, written let-ring and bends retain tails. Song details → **Keep short notation sustains** restores short source tails when desired. Applies to all five-/six-fret Guitar, Rhythm and Bass parts and is reported as a representation decision.
- **Precise scrubbing:** Pattern Playhead/Start beat and Lyrics Seek controls span most of their panel width. Idle updates do not round the playback clock or restart playback.
- **Lyric grid:** the waveform viewer draws measure/beat/subdivision bars. Default subdivision is 1/4 beat (sixteenth notes), with options down to 1/16 beat. Enable **Snap lyrics to beats** for numeric timestamp edits, first-lyric alignment, viewer clicks and the Seek slider. Rows offer **To playhead**, **Snap**, and **Seek**. Snap works in musical time with tempo changes and converts back to file time using both lyric and recording offsets. It never changes the original LRC automatically; save/export writes a separate aligned copy.
- **Checkbox help:** hover over instrument, difficulty, mapping, dynamics, kick, tempo, sustain, GHL, lyric snap, Star Power and video-loop options to see what they do.
- **Live drum colors:** red labels mean Ignore; yellow labels identify source pitches involved in simultaneous same-pad collisions, including tom/cymbal overlaps. Colors clear or change on the next redraw after reassignment. These are attack conflicts, not the written duration of percussion notes.
- **Music video:** choose **Music video** in Pattern Preview or Extra media. FFmpeg extracts its audio into the in-memory waveform/preview; export writes that audio as `song.wav` and copies the original video. Changing the shared Audio alignment pads/trims the extracted audio and assigns the matching video playback offset automatically. +250 ms audio alignment writes `video_start_time = -250`; -250 ms writes `+250`. The video's original bytes remain intact, and all charted parts share their existing note alignment. Selecting a music video replaces a separate video-background selection. Clear it to return to your saved separate recording. Supported video inputs are MP4, AVI, WebM, OGV and MPEG; a usable audio track is required. There is no embedded video player in the preview.

Video offset sign reference: [song.ini standard tags](https://thenathannator.github.io/GuitarGame_ChartFormats/Chart-File-Formats/song-ini/Standard-Tags/).

GHL musical pitch and preview order is **B1, B2, B3, W1, W2, W3**, lowest to highest. Phrase mappings preserve that order; the export uses the required file codes (3, 4, 8, 0, 1, 2). Physical columns/rows are still considered for ergonomics. Long runs reuse positions only at documented resets.

Preview clock sliders now round and clamp only when edited. Automatic playhead updates no longer request a seek or recreate the audio stream on every frame; the same fix applies to Lyrics playback.

Renamed with the supplied FretForge icon in the window, sidebar and Windows executable. Five- and six-fret Guitar, Rhythm and Bass now follow the supplied literal Expert policies. All Expert attack times are retained, long six-button melodies use position resets, dense significant triads remain chords, transposed riffs reuse shapes, and individual note releases are preserved where compatible. Export reports expose reductions, technique inference, resets and rounding. See [implementation details](RULEBOOK-IMPLEMENTATION.md) and the two supplied rulesets.

A native Windows desktop recreation of [Chart Starter](https://github.com/shytheprogrammer/Chart-Starter), with a modern dark interface and a Rust conversion engine.

## Launch

Double-click **FretForge.exe**. Keep `vendor`, `gp_bridge.cjs`, and `examples` beside the executable. The portable package includes Node.js and FFmpeg; no Python, Rust, Node, or FFmpeg installation is needed to use it. Files are processed locally.

1. Browse or drop a Guitar Pro score, or try one of the included demos.
2. Select Drums, Guitar, Bass, and Rhythm tracks. Check the note preview and drum mapping. The live collision summary under the preview updates after each MIDI reassignment and shows whether you reduced or increased overlapping hits. Expand collision details to see named source sounds and jump to their positions.
3. Set the overall chart BPM directly on Score & tracks or in Song details. Both controls share one value for every instrument and difficulty, lyric timing, ratings and export; recordings are not stretched. Set song information, enabled difficulties, and optional rating overrides.
4. Attach the matching recording in Pattern preview. Press **Play**, click the preview to seek, and drag its background waveform left/right to line it up with the notes. Use **< 1 bar** / **1 bar >** to move every charted instrument and difficulty together. Attach optional LRC lyrics, artwork, backgrounds, or synchronized stems.
5. Open **Lyrics** to manage standard/enhanced LRC files, edit words and times, review repaired backward timestamps and align the first lyric to the audio playhead.
6. Choose an export folder and create the song package.
7. Open `notes.chart` in Moonscraper, review timing and every difficulty and instrument, and playtest in Clone Hero.

Save/open projects preserve settings and file paths in JSON. Attached files remain at their original locations.

## Playback and alignment

The sixteen-beat preview draws the recording's waveform behind the notes and follows the moving playhead during playback. Play/Pause, Stop, volume, a playhead slider, and the start-beat slider let you review different sections. Click the preview to seek; drag it horizontally to change audio alignment, or type an exact millisecond value.

**Constant BPM**, beside the BPM number on Score & tracks and Song details, overrides every Guitar Pro tempo change. When checked, export writes exactly one BPM flag at tick zero using the entered BPM, even after shifting notes. When unchecked (the default), Overall BPM scales the source tempo map relative to its first tempo. Time signatures remain preserved in either mode. Playback, lyrics, spacing audits, intensity ratings and export use the selected timing mode. The setting is saved with the project; older projects default to unchecked. Changing BPM does not stretch the recording.

Moving audio right adds leading silence to the exported recording. Moving it left removes that amount from the beginning, including any music in that interval. Aligned audio exports as 24-bit WAV, preserving its original sample rate and channels. All full-length audio stems receive the same adjustment. Preview excerpts are kept intact. The exported `song.ini` delay and chart offset stay zero because alignment is already applied to the audio. Original files are never modified. An adjustment that removes an entire recording or stem is rejected.

The note arrows change one shared offset in starting-meter bars across every instrument and difficulty, even when you are previewing only one part: four quarter-note beats for a 4/4 source, three for a 3/4 source, and so on. Each click applies the same tick offset to every part. Tempo/time-signature changes, sections and Star Power move with the notes. The left arrow stops before the earliest selected note would cross time zero. LRC lyrics stay tied to the recording and follow audio alignment and their separate lyric offset. Reset buttons restore the original note/audio positions. Saved projects retain both offsets; earlier projects' audio delay is carried into the new alignment.

Preview decoding uses up to 256 MB of audio memory (about 23 minutes of stereo sound). Longer recordings can still be exported, with alignment entered numerically. Playback requires an available audio output device. BPM changes move the musical grid; audio is not stretched.

## LRC lyrics and alignment (v1.4.0)

The **Lyrics** tab replaces the pitched-vocal screen. It opens or creates standard and enhanced LRC, provides editable timestamp/word rows and a raw-text editor, previews lyric markers over the recording waveform, and saves aligned LRC copies. Play/Pause, Stop, a seek slider, row-level **Seek** buttons and click-to-seek support reviewing synchronization. LRC editing and recording playback also work without a loaded Guitar Pro score. Pitched YARG vocals, vocal difficulty tags and `notes.mid` export have been removed.

**Normal LRC:** each nonfinal phrase ends exactly one chart tick before the next phrase starts, even across tempo changes or long gaps. The final phrase reaches the chart end; the chart extends when necessary to contain the final lyric. Multiple line timestamps and embedded `[offset:...]` values remain supported.

**Enhanced LRC:** words from a source line share one phrase and keep their written order. When a timestamp moves backward, the app finds the preceding valid lyric and the next later lyric, then spaces the intervening backward-timestamp run evenly between those two anchors. For example, times `10, 8, 7, 16` become `10, 12, 14, 16`. A later line can provide the next anchor. Runs with no following anchor, or too little time between anchors, show an actionable message so you can supply a valid later timestamp.

The tab prominently notifies you about repairs and lists each affected lyric's source line, original time and repaired time. Edited lyrics and repair notices persist in saved projects. Export also writes the changes to `conversion-report.json` and `LYRIC-REVIEW.txt`, and the export summary/status reports the repair count. You can adjust timestamps later in the row editor or raw LRC text. **Use repaired timestamps in editor** updates the editable copy while retaining review notices.

**Starting point:** seek to the first sung word and click **Align first lyric to playhead**, type the desired **First lyric at** time, or use the ±100 ms buttons/global lyric offset. Every lyric moves by the same amount; charted notes and audio keep their positions. The offset is saved with the project. Recording alignment is also added to the exported lyric timing, so padded/trimmed audio and lyrics stay together. Negative export times clamp to zero. `lyrics.lrc` and chart lyric events use the same repaired and adjusted timings.

**Save aligned LRC copy** includes the current lyric offset and recording alignment. Normal/enhanced timestamp style and artist/title metadata are preserved; embedded file offsets are folded into the saved timestamps. In-memory editing and song export preserve the original LRC file. Choosing the original filename in the save dialog would explicitly replace it; use a new filename for a separate copy.

For scores with embedded lyrics, **Make an LRC from Guitar Pro lyrics** imports a selected track/verse into the editor with current score timing and repeats. This is an editable timing snapshot: reimport after changing the score's BPM or bar position. It provides lyric text only, without generating pitched vocal gameplay.

Use **Try lyric demo**, or launch with `--demo-lyrics --page=5`, to inspect the included backward-timestamp example and practice alignment against a synthesized recording.

## Scope and differences

The UI and conversion/export logic are Rust. Guitar Pro decoding intentionally retains the upstream JavaScript/alphaTab importer and its bundled Node runtime; this is not an all-Rust GP parser.

Guitar, Rhythm and Bass now follow the supplied [five-fret literal ruleset](5_fret_charting_ruleset.md). See [Rulebook implementation](RULEBOOK-IMPLEMENTATION.md) for the exact automated policy and the musical decisions that still require listening. Easy uses three colored lanes and singles; Medium uses four colors and at most two-note chords; Hard uses all five colors without opens/taps; Expert retains all source attacks. Guitar Pro open strings remain colored notes. Purple bass notes require an explicit gameplay annotation on Expert, not a zero fret number.

This recreates the original workflow rather than promising identical output. The Rust fret-mapping, difficulty-reduction, intensity, lyric-phrase, and Star Power heuristics are independent implementations. They do not reproduce every special-case rule in the original Python algorithms. Enhanced LRC words share source-line phrases; backward timestamps are repaired by interpolation between valid lyric anchors. Timing comes from the Guitar Pro playback map; it is not automatically transcribed from the recording. These outputs are charting aids and require musical review. Intentional overlapping extended sustains and open chords are not generated automatically; individual chord-note releases are retained with conservative clearance before subsequent attacks. Aligned recordings and stems are converted to WAV; other media is copied intact. Custom assets under `Extras/Custom` require separate installation.

## Build from source

The GitHub source ZIP contains the Rust source, lockfile, importer, alphaTab, demos and license notices. It excludes compiled executables, build caches and test exports. Extract it and upload the contents of the `fretforge` directory to your GitHub repository. The Windows release is provided separately; macOS and Linux releases are not included.

Install stable Rust and the platform's native build tools. On Windows, the standard MSVC Rust toolchain with Visual Studio C++ Build Tools is recommended.

```text
cargo test --locked
cargo build --release --locked
```

For source tests/builds, place Node.js and FFmpeg on PATH, or copy `vendor/node.exe` and `vendor/ffmpeg.exe` from the supplied Windows release into this source tree. The GitHub source ZIP excludes these large runtime binaries. Copy `target/release/fretforge.exe` beside this README and rename it `FretForge.exe`. Keep `gp_bridge.cjs`, `vendor` and `examples` alongside it. The provided Windows release already includes all runtime files. Only the Windows build is validated here.

For the bundled end-to-end conversion check:

```text
FretForge.exe --smoke-test
```

This exports all three demos under `smoke-output`. `--demo` opens the guitar demo. `--demo-drums --demo-audio` opens the drum demo with a synthesized practice recording. `--capture` saves a preview screenshot using the application's own renderer and closes after capture. The optional native audio device check is `cargo test native_device_playback_clock_pause_and_seek -- --ignored` (silent playback).

## Licensing

Derived from Chart Starter by shytheprogrammer, under the MIT license retained in `LICENSE`. The alphaTab license is in `vendor/alphatab/LICENSE`; the Node license is in `vendor/NODE-LICENSE.txt`. The separate bundled FFmpeg executable is the Gyan.dev GPLv3 build `2025-08-25-git-1b62f9d3ae`; its license, source URL and build configuration are in `vendor/FFMPEG-LICENSE.txt` and `vendor/FFMPEG-BUILD-README.txt`. Rust dependency notices accompany the portable distribution under `licenses`, including Rodio/CPAL for native playback. The synthesized demo recordings is provided under this project's MIT license. The original help reference is retained as `ORIGINAL-GUIDE.md`; use the in-app Guide for behavior specific to this Rust edition.

## Preview controls (v1.4.0)

Extra media contains artwork, backgrounds, stems and other optional assets. All LRC file management, lyric editing and alignment lives in Lyrics. Attach the main recording in the pattern or lyric preview.

Both previews offer quarter-beat navigation and independent Zoom in, Zoom out and Reset zoom controls (1–64 beats). These viewing controls do not alter exported timing. The pattern preview also offers quarter-bar note shifts; these move every instrument and difficulty together and are included in exports.

## Drum cymbals (v1.4.0)

Easy and Medium retain cymbal markers for retained cymbal hits, just like Hard and Expert. Rhythm spacing and simultaneous-hit limits still simplify lower difficulties. Tom hits remain toms.

## Guitar Hero Live parts (v1.4.0)

Enable **GHL Guitar**, **GHL Bass**, and **GHL Rhythm** in Score & tracks. Each has its own source track and rating, and can coexist with five-fret parts. The preview labels all six buttons and OPEN; playback, zoom, and global alignment work for these parts too.

The supplied six-fret literal Expert ruleset drives the dedicated mapper: whole-phrase template search, progression-aware chord optimization, deterministic riff-family caching (including transposition and shared prefixes), pedal-tone opens, explicit picking/legato/taps, and trimmed sustains. Chords use at most three buttons, avoiding same-column barres by default. Expert retains source attacks; Easy/Medium/Hard simplify the arrangement at the original timestamps.

In Song details, disable **GHL open pedal tones** to require fretted pedals. **GHL octave folding** is optional and collapses octave-equivalent melody pitches, with review notices. Phrases with more than six melody pitches reuse buttons at position resets without losing events. Resets and any changed contour are reported. Manual per-note overrides are not exposed. Optional simple same-column barres can now be enabled for Hard/Expert.

Exports include Easy/Medium/Hard/Expert GHLGuitar, GHLBass and GHLRhythm sections for enabled difficulties, the matching song.ini ratings, shared tempo/meter, and Star Power. B3 is note 8; 5 and 6 remain modifiers. Format reference: https://thenathannator.github.io/GuitarGame_ChartFormats/Chart-File-Formats/chart-format/Tracks/6-Fret-Guitar/ . Older four-instrument project files migrate automatically. Charts are validated programmatically; review and play-test the generated parts in your target game.

## Musical Star Power placement (v1.4.0)

Star Power now follows the meter and tempo map for every part and difficulty. Phrases normally span two measures, changing toward one for dense passages or four for sparse ones. Placement favors section beginnings/endings and rhythmic transitions; phrase endings favor downbeats, accented attacks and chord emphasis. Phrases include the final emphasized hit, ending one tick after it.

The hard spacing rule is **four full measures from the end of one phrase to the start of the next**. The planner targets about eight measures / 15 seconds and avoids gaps over 30 seconds when playable notes and minimum spacing allow. At slow tempos or through long rests these targets can conflict; the hard minimum is preserved and review notices explain the gap. Short final passages may need truncated phrases, also reported.

Gold bands show the planned phrases in the pattern preview. Coverage notices appear below it, in CHARTING-REVIEW.txt and in conversion-report.json. The Generate Star Power checkbox turns generation off completely. Global note shifts move phrases with the notes, and changing BPM replans timed gaps. The quarter-bar collection/drain rule is used as placement guidance; the exported S 2 phrases let the game handle meter gain, activation and drain. Generated choices still need musical review against the recording.

## Six-fret patterns and shapes (v1.4.0)

The included GHL_All_Notes_and_Common_Patterns.md supplements the new six-fret literal ruleset; earlier policies are historical references. Its 64 mathematical states are a reference, not a list of chord shapes to generate. The mapper still avoids simultaneous open/fretted chords, four-to-six-button clusters, and barre-plus-other-fret grips.

The phrase template library now includes black-first staircases, cross-row zigzags and additional alternating-row paths. Chord optimization favors natural neighboring dyads and penalizes large outer diagonals and crowded three-button grips. Sparse, musically justified triples remain available; Expert triads retain three distinct musical voices even at high speed.

Song details has an optional **GHL simple barres (Hard/Expert)** checkbox, off by default. Uncrowded octave dyads can use same-column black/white pairs; dense passages favor easier grips. Easy and Medium simplify barres. Square preview notes identify the paired buttons, and review notices flag these shapes for controller play-testing.

The GHL review identifies common mapped sequences, including picking/tremolo, gallops, triplet runs, trills, row alternation, zigzags, staircases, chord repetition and chord shifts. These informational notices describe the generated chart rather than adding notes or modifiers. Picking, legato, taps and sustain timing follow the new literal Expert ruleset. Identical riffs remain deterministic. Older projects load with the new barre option disabled.

Windows source builds require Rust plus a Windows resource compiler: `windres` for GNU. MSVC builds embed the generated resource directly without an additional compiler. The supplied icon is embedded during compilation. The portable Windows release requires no development tools.
